# Ideas

- [ ] Allow help text to be added to a field
- [ ] Allow a developer to specify a closure to generate a field label
- [ ] Required / Optional fields and the display of them
- [ ] Allow validation (required, max etc) to be specified in the form of an array or as an instance of a validator on the form component
- [ ] Automatically infer the validation from a form controller based on the route / route + method
- [ ] Allow help text / field names etc to be specified in a central location
- [ ] Don't auto fill hidden model attributes
- [ ] Use an actual DTO to represent the Field, rather than just passing the component around
- [ ] Automatically apply model route params if the data element passed to the form is an instance of the required model
